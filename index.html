<h2>About me</h2>
<p>My name is <strong>Trinity Young</strong>, and I enjoy doing things like playing games both on devices and off devices, baking goodies, and learning about some of my interests. I am very determined in my work, and I strive to complete tasks as quickly and efficiently as possible. Some things I also enjoy are animals, food, plants, space, and more. I am currently trying to learn how to paint and play the piano. Regarding the piano, I have always enjoyed piano music and have always wanted to learn how to play it.</p>

<p>I have one brother and a pet dog. My brother's name is Oliver, and my dog's name is Duke. Duke is a <a href="images/doggy.jpg"target="_blank">black lab</a>. We rescued him and have had him since he was just a puppy. Our family is pretty close, and we live on a mountain in the woods, so we see wildlife a lot, and sometimes it gets really cold or really hot up there. I strive to maintain good grades and a high GPA in school, and I enjoy learning new things. I am also very open to new things and opportunities.</p>
