        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio. Here is where I will be showing you all of my information that you should find useful. First of all, my name is Trinity Young, and I aspire to be a game developer and coder. I have gone to James 	Rumsey Institute and got some certifications and awards while there. In my course, I have learned many skills, including Python, CSS, HTML, and more, which will help advance my future career. I have some experience in creating small websites, as well as developing small games and working with 3D elements in Unity.</p>
