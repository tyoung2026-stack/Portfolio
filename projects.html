        <p>This is the first website I've ever made, and it was the first and
        original index for my portfolio. This matters to me because this made me
        really happy to see work and come alive, and it also shows how much farther
        i've gotten and how much I've learned.</p>

        <p>This shows a website that I made recently and was very proud of,
        because I had made a map of it, and because this was the first time
        I've used symbols, emojis, and been able to put a video on the website.</p>

	<h5>Differences between Canvas vs. SVG</h5>
	<p>A main difference is that the canvas element acts as a virtual canvas and has a pixel-based
	approach compared SVG, which uses XML to describe two-dimensional vector graphics.</p>
